1) Does the program type-check?
=> It is good. 
2) Can the program be compiled to executable object code?
=> Yes, it could be.
3) Have you tested the program? How should it be done?
=> Yes, I've. Even though program compile with "make" or "patscc filename" but their is some kind of logic error in
   mylist_length(). Other than that everyother function is passing true value in assertloc.
